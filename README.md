# LeetCode Solutions by Jeffrey Concerto

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This collection showcases my problem-solving journey through various coding challenges on LeetCode. It reflects my commitment to continuous learning and honing my skills as a software engineer.

## About Me

I am Jeffrey Concerto, a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. My background includes a MicroBachelors in Programming & Data Structures from NYUx and extensive experience with Swift and SwiftUI, among other technologies. My academic journey was marked by my achievements as a dual major in English and Motion Pictures at the University of Miami, where I was awarded Most Outstanding Senior in Motion Pictures. My diverse experiences, from coding to storytelling, have equipped me with a unique perspective on approaching challenges.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository contains solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems across different difficulty levels (**Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**). Each solution is written in Swift and is accompanied by clear and concise explanations.

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is a platform that I use to continually challenge myself and improve my coding skills. It allows me to stay sharp and keep up with the latest algorithms and data structures that are crucial in the tech industry. I do at least one LeetCode problem a day to make sure I'm on top of my game. I don't always upload my answers, especially if its a question I needed help on.

## Highlights
- **Honesty**: My solutions are my solutions. There are many I posted previously, that currently I may solve a different way, but where my solution at the time.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: My solutions prioritize both time and space efficiency.
- **Clean Code**: I follow best practices in coding, ensuring that my solutions are not only correct but also readable and maintainable.
- **Continuous Learning**: I regularly update this repository with new solutions as I tackle more LeetCode problems.
